This is intended to be Timeline proof for the NS proof. 
Dated 7th August, 2025: Sent the minimal proof for mathematical reasoning to IITG professors through my IITG email itself.
Dated 21st August, 2025: One didn't reply, the other didn't reply as well but I called him at personal number. Despite being in computational fluid flow research interest, he said it's not his research interest. (i guess Turbulence is of no interest to him)
Dated 7th September, 2025: Subitted to arxiv at 5th. Hoping, it would get published there properly. Posting the exact PDF file here as well.
